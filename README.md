The global level of credit adjustment is the key understanding about how to manage one's financial investment strategy and the contemporary politics mainly affects this credit adjustment and generates dynamics of it.
Thus the repo will provide the backbone of this working principles and crucial study materials about how to analyze and invest on the financial assets according to the dynamical change of global political/economical landscape.

## Key Clues 

Following is the key clues on how to penetrate the essence of political economy.

1. Economic Machine works with Credit. People borrow and lend the residual money to others and those money flow generates productivity.  

2. When Economic Growth - measured by GDP usually - does not look well working, Central Bank/ Policy Makers prints the money and those are injected into society with low interest rate. We call this `Monetary Policy`. Then money goes to the people who can generate productivity and economic machine starts to work again.

3. If interest rate hit 0%, however, printing money does not lower the interest rate anymore, and not working. This has happened at `Great Depression(1929-1939)` and `Sub Prime Mortgage(2008-2015)`

4. Then Central Bank performs `Quantitative Easing`, which is to buy financial asset directly and makes the people get richer who has already held a financial assets. This widens the `wealth gap`. 

5. Usually, if the `wealth gap` widened, people get lost of his `opportunity` to get a fine job which enables them to show his potential to the society, thus the people get interested in the political parties which supports `populism`. Thus some people call this `wealth gap` as a `opportunity gap`.
 
### Technical Modelling 

#### Intervention Score

This score is used to predict the demand for USD. If US maintains the intervention stance, this will lead to the US hegemony getting supported and people recognize and wants to buy USD more and more.

- Or, Since the logic between the intervention always leads to the US hegemony strengthened, we might can consider the `hegemony score` instead.
